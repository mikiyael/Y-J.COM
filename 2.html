  <p>The first time I had feelings for you, it hit me in a way I wasn’t prepared for, like a sudden warmth that I didn’t know I was missing until it was there. I remember the way you smiled, how your laugh seemed to linger in the air, and the way you spoke so effortlessly, as if everything about you was meant to capture me. It wasn’t a single moment, but a collection of little things—your kindness, your energy, and the way you made me feel seen and understood. I realized that I wasn’t just happy around you; I felt different, like my world was a little lighter just by having you in it. It scared me a little at first because I knew these feelings were real, but it also felt right—like I was supposed to feel this way for you. From that moment, I couldn’t stop thinking about you, and I knew that you were becoming someone so important to me, someone who would hold a special place in my heart.</p>
