<p>finally, I want to finish by saying how truly sorry I am for all the times I’ve messed things up, and most of all, for not giving you the time and attention you deserve. I know I haven’t always been the partner you needed me to be, and I’ve let moments slip away where I should have been there for you, listening, supporting, and making you feel valued. You are so important to me, and it breaks my heart to think I’ve ever made you feel overlooked, unappreciated, or alone. I’ve been caught up in my own world at times, distracted by things that don’t matter nearly as much as you do, and I take full responsibility for that. You are the most incredible part of my life—the one person who’s always been patient, understanding, and forgiving even when I didn’t deserve it. And I see now, more than ever, how lucky I am to have you.

    I know apologies alone aren’t enough, but I promise you I will do better, not just in words, but in my actions. You deserve a partner who prioritizes you, someone who makes you feel loved every single day, without question or doubt. I’m sorry for every time I let you down and for every moment you felt I wasn’t there for you. I don’t want you to think that my lack of time or attention reflects how much I care for you, because the truth is, you are everything to me. I’ve realized that love isn’t just about big gestures—it’s about showing up every day, being present, and making you feel like you’re the most cherished person in the world, because you are. I want to prove to you that I can be better, that I can love you the way you deserve to be loved. I don’t want to take you for granted anymore, and I promise to make you and our relationship a priority. I love you with all my heart, and I will spend every day working to make things right and show you that you mean everything to me. I can’t stop thinking about all the moments where I could have done better—moments where you needed me, but I let my own distractions get in the way. It pains me to know that my actions, or lack of them, may have hurt you or made you feel unimportant, because you are anything but that to me. You are the light in my life, the one person who brings me peace, joy, and love, and I feel like I’ve failed you by not showing up the way I should have. I’ve taken your patience and kindness for granted, and that’s not fair to you. You’ve given so much of yourself to this relationship, and yet, I didn’t always give you the same in return. I see that now, and it’s a hard truth to face because I never want you to feel like you’re in this alone. I never want you to doubt how much I care for you, how much I need you, and how deeply I love you.

    You deserve all the time, attention, and effort I can possibly give, because you are the most beautiful, loving, and caring person I’ve ever known. I’ve been selfish at times, wrapped up in things that don’t matter, and I hate that it took me this long to realize how much you were silently hurting. It kills me to think that I could have made you feel alone or unappreciated, because I promised to be the one who would always lift you up, make you smile, and remind you how incredible you are. I’ve been falling short of that promise, and for that, I am deeply, deeply sorry.
    
    I don’t want this to just be another apology—I want this to be the turning point where I prove to you, every single day, that you are my priority. I will be there when you need me, I will make time for you no matter what, and I will cherish every moment we spend together because I know how precious you are. I will work on myself to be a better man for you—someone who supports you, listens to you, and makes you feel seen and loved in every way possible. You mean the world to me, and I will never stop trying to show you that. I’m not perfect, and I’ll probably mess up again, but please know that I will never stop loving you and working to be better for us. You’re worth every effort, every sacrifice, and every ounce of love I have to give. I love you so much, and I will spend the rest of my days proving that to you.</p>
