    <p>Our first date is a memory I hold so close to my heart, like itâ€™s frozen in time. I remember how nervous and excited I was leading up to it, wanting everything to be perfect because it was you. From the moment I saw you, all my nerves melted awayâ€”you looked so beautiful, and your presence just put me at ease. Every moment felt natural, like we had known each other forever, yet everything about you was still new and captivating. The way we talked, laughed, and shared little pieces of ourselves and the stairs tooðŸ˜‰ made me realize how special you truly are. I caught myself staring at you more than once, amazed that I was lucky enough to be sitting across from someone like you. The world seemed to blur around us, and it felt like it was just you and me, like nothing else mattered in that moment. Blenye That day wasnâ€™t just a first dateâ€”it was the beginning of something real, something I knew I wanted to keep building with you. Looking back, itâ€™s still one of my favorite memories, because it was the start of us. I would have put some pictures but I can't cuz we didn't take any
